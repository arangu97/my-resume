        description: "During my Erasmus stay in Warsaw I carried out my final thesis in which I was directly involved in a project at the Politechnika Warszawska University. The project developed LoRa communication between IoT devices that measured certain compounds in the city's sewage system and sent the data via a LoRaWAN network to a server in the university's cloud. This experience allowed me to develop my microcontroller programming skills as well as enhanced my understanding of IoT networks for integration with cloud services."
